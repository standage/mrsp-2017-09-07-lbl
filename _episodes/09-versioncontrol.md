questions:
- "How should I manage work using version control?"
objectives:
- "Explain how to use feature branches to manage software development."
keypoints:
- "Use version control for everything created manually, not just code."
- "Create a new branch for each feature."
- "Only use that branch for that feature."
- "Merge and delete the branch when the feature is complete."

## Version Control

*   We assume your project is already under version control
    *   If not, this may not be the right course for you
*   We also assume you use version control for everything created by human beings
    *   A major reason for the existence and survival of tools like LaTeX and Markdown
    *   Collaboration would be a *lot* easier if version control systems knew
        how to manage rich document formats...
*   Use a *[feature branch workflow]({{"/reference/#feature-branch" | absolute_url}})*
    *   Designate one branch as the main development branch (typically called `master`)
    *   Create a new branch for each feature from `master`
    *   Only use that branch for that feature
    *   Merge the branch when the feature is done

## Build Manager

*   Use a build manager
    *   [GNU Make][gnu-make] defined the category, but depends on native shell commands
    *   [CMake][cmake] is a meta-tool that creates build files for multiple systems
    *   [SCons][scons] and similar tools define build rules in a full-blown programming language
*   Originally created to compile multi-file programs efficiently, but can all be used for arbitrary tasks
    *   Run tests, build packages for release, create reports, ...
    *   Common pattern: build shell script or utility program, then launch from build file
*   Key feature: dependencies
    *   "X depends on Y depends on Z"
    *   Usually implemented using timestamps or hashes
    *   Not well suited to verbs
*   General workflow tools may be a better fit for actual scientific work
    *   [Galaxy][galaxy] is a high-end tool
    *   [doit][pydoit] is a lot easier to start with
    *   Only as stable as the pieces they connect

## Checklists

*   A checklist is a build file meant to be executed by human beings
    *   *[The Checklist Manifesto][gawande-checklist-manifesto]*
        describes how use of checklists cuts fatalities in surgery significantly,
        along with many other examples
*   Use them for anything that *can't* be done automatically by a machine
*   Keep in version control
    *   Ask every new contributor/user to use *and give feedback*
*   Include a contact email address in every checklist
