title: "Distribute Your Software"
teaching: 5
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How should I package my software for release?"
objectives:
- "Explain how and why to describe software dependencies in machine-readable form."
- "Explain why development machines should always be set up using package descriptions."
keypoints:
- "Every software ecosystem now includes a package manager to track and update dependencies."
- "Describe software versions in precise machine-readable form to take advantage of these."
- "Always set up development machines using the package description in order to ensure it's up to date."

*   Describe dependencies in machine-readable form
    *   E.g., Python's `requirements.txt` gives package names, and optionally (ranges of) versions

> ## Requirements for a Simple Website
>
> This `requirements.txt` file specifies that a website needs Django version 1.9.something,
> any version of PyYAML,
> and Version 2.0 or later of the requests library.
> Running `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the command line
> will find and install this software.
>
> ~~~
> Django>=1.9,<1.10
> PyYAML
> requests>=2.0
> ~~~
> {: .source}

*   Set up development machines using a package manager
    *   Doesn't guarantee that the file is up to date, but it helps
*   Use the same package description to install software on users' machines
*   Package managers are often painful to work with
    *   Like standards, everybody has their own
    *   Often language-specific
    *   Often complex (because they're solving complex problems)
    *   Focus on libraries - generally don't address extra development tools

> ## Dependencies
>
> 1.  Describe your project's dependencies in the format shown above
>     (or if you're using some other package management system, its preferred format).
> 2.  How do you know the list is correct?
>     How would you know if something changed and it fell out of date?
