*   It's tempting to think of science as purely meritocratic
    *   If I do good science, it should speak for itself
    *   Advertising is pretentious and self-serving
*   In reality, scientists are social creatures
    *   We all have our own social networks of trust
    *   Technology has helped with discoverability of new research
    *   Still not as effective as getting airtime from a "high-profile" outlet
        *   "Glamour" journal (Nature, Science, etc.)
        *   Twitter account of a "big shot" in the field
*   Don't be afraid to [market your project][kuchner-marketing]
    *   If it really is good, you should tell people about it
*   The concert merchandise model
    *   Your grant proposals are your product
    *   Your papers are your advertisements
*   What do your grant proposals promise? And what part does software play in your research?
    *   New theories?
    *   New models?
    *   New results?
    *   New tools?
*   We should clarify what marketing means
    *   It is not being pushy
    *   It is not shameless self-promotion
    *   "Marketing is the craft of seeing things from other people's perspective, understanding their wants and needs, and finding ways to meet them." --Marc Kuchner
    *   It is connecting with others in a sincere way
    *   It is ensuring our work is relevant to important people and their concerns
*   Use social media and blogs
    *   Papers must be objective, social media posts don't
    *   Worst-case scenario: nobody will listen
    *   Best-case: the right people will notice and advertise your work
*   Make the main paper(s) you want people to cite obvious, in the documentation and in a CITATION file alongside the README
    *   If there isn't a paper yet, get agreement on what's needed for a "code paper"
    *   Journals like [JOSS][joss] and [JORS][jors] have clear guidelines and checklists
    *   Keep planning for future papers and how people should be credited for their work so that the community remains engaged and committed
    *   See [this example][software-paper-authorship] of a discussion
