title: "Issue Trackers"
teaching: 5
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I keep track of what needs to be done?"
objectives:
- "Describe what sorts of things should be recorded in an issue-tracking system."
- "Describe what goes into a well-written issue."
- "Explain how issue-tracking systems can be used to implement workflows."
- "Explain how issue-tracking systems can be used to focus attention where it's needed."
keypoints:
- "An issue-tracking system is a shared to-do list for a project."
- "Every issue has a few mandatory fields to help with searching, and free-form text for details."
- "Every issue is in a particular state."
- "A project can define a workflow by specifying who can change tickets' states when."
- "Use tickets to prioritize work: what needs be done now, what can be deferred until later."

## Issue Tracking

*   Issue-tracking tools are often called bug trackers
    *   Well-organized teams use them as a shared to-do list to manage everything
    *   "Version control tells us where we've been; issue tracking tells us where we're going."
*   Every task is recorded as a separate ticket
    *   Unique ID
    *   One-line summary to aid browsing
    *   Status (sometimes organized by [stages of grief][twitter-grief])
    *   Owner (i.e., who's responsible)
    *   Full description that may include screenshots, error messages, etc.
    *   History: who created it when, how it has been modified
    *   Threaded discussion

Summary: Message file reader crashes on accented characters
Description:
1.  Create a text file called 'accent.msg' containing the message
    "PÃ¼mpernickel" (with an umlaut over the 'u').

2.  Run 'python mindcontrol.py --all --message accent.msg'

Program crashes with the message "No encoding for [] on line 1 of 'accent.msg'".
([] shows where a solid black box appears in the output instead of a printable
character.)

*   More sophisticated systems allow people to:
    *   Record dependencies between tickets
    *   Estimate how long work will take
    *   Record how long work actually took
*   Can be used to make the development lifecycle explicit
    *   I.e., only allow certain state transitions
    *   And notify interested parties of state transitions

*   Don't worry about any of this until people are actually filing issues
*   Key use: prioritization
    1.  What has to be done right now?
    2.  What should be done soon?
    3.  What can safely be left until later?
*   Another use is to show that you're working on someone
    *   Assigning to someone or setting an "in progress" tag can save a lot of wasted effort
    *   And reassure anxious users
*   Criteria for decision:
    1.  How much do we need this?
    2.  How long will it take?

> ## What's Your Lifecycle?
>
> 1.  What states can your project's issues be in?
> 2.  What state transitions are allowed?  ("Any to any" is a common and acceptable answer.)
> 3.  Who decides when an issue can move from one state to another?
